K-Means Clustering

There are many models for clustering out there. In this notebook, we will be presenting the model that is considered one of the simplest models amongst them. Despite its simplicity, the K-means is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from unlabeled data. In this notebook, you will learn how to use k-Means for customer segmentation.

Hierarchical Clustering - Agglomerative

We will be looking at a clustering technique, which is Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. Remember that agglomerative is the bottom up approach.
we will be looking at Agglomerative clustering, which is more popular than Divisive clustering.
